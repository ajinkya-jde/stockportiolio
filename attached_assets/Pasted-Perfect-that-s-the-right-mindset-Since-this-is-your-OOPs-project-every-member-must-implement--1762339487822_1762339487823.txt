Perfect — that’s the right mindset 👏
Since this is your OOPs project, every member must implement or demonstrate some Object-Oriented Programming concept (like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, etc.) — not just frontend or database work.
So let’s redesign the team division to ensure each person codes an OOP-based component, while still keeping it doable in 1.5 days with JDBC and a web frontend.

2 PM – 5 PM	Member E builds frontend pages; Member D links JDBC with test data; integration begins.
5 PM – 8 PM	Combine modules → test data flow from UI → servlet → backend → DB.
Day 2 (Half Day)
Time	Tasks
9 AM – 11 AM	Full project testing, bug fixing, and final linking.
11 AM – 1 PM	Add enhancements (leaderboard, price fluctuation, charts) + prepare viva presentation.
________________________________________
🎤 Viva Prep Guide (for Each Member)
Member	Possible Viva Questions
A (Market Logic)	What is an interface? How is polymorphism achieved in your Stock class?
B (Portfolio)	Explain inheritance and composition in your User–Portfolio relation.
C (Transactions)	Why did you use an abstract class for transactions? What’s the benefit?
D (Database)	Explain how JDBC connects to MySQL. What’s a PreparedStatement?
E (Web UI & Servlets)	How do servlets communicate with backend classes? Explain request–response flow.

Would you like me to generate a complete shared team task table (Google Sheet / Markdown) with member names, tasks, OOP concepts, and deadlines so you can divide the work efficiently and show it to your instructor as a planning document?

Excellent 👏 — since you have 5 members, 1.5 days, and everyone is doing OOP-related coding in Java + JDBC + Web UI, the key is to:
1️⃣ Start in parallel with clear module ownership,
2️⃣ Follow a consistent folder/package structure, and
3️⃣ Integrate smoothly via shared classes, interfaces, and servlets.
Let’s break it down step by step — how each of you will start working, develop, and integrate into one functional project.
________________________________________
🧩 Phase 1: Setup (1–2 hours)
Common setup (All Members do together)
1.	Create a shared GitHub repo or Google Drive folder:
📁 StockMarketPortfolioSimulator/
2.	Decide on the package structure:
3.	com.project.model
4.	com.project.interfaces
5.	com.project.dao
6.	com.project.controller
7.	com.project.utils
8.	Member D (DB/JDBC Lead) creates and shares DatabaseConnection.java early so everyone can use the same connection method.
9.	Agree on naming conventions (e.g., camelCase variables, PascalCase class names).
10.	Everyone adds a placeholder .java file to test integration setup.
________________________________________
⚙️ Phase 2: Individual Work (Core Module Development)
Each member starts coding their module independently but with compatible structure.
Here’s how each member should begin:
________________________________________
🧑‍💻 Member A – Market & Stock Logic
Goal: Build the stock behavior (prices, updates, list).
Start work:
1.	Create PriceChangeable.java (interface with method void updatePrice(double percentChange);)
2.	Create Stock.java:
o	Fields: symbol, companyName, price, changePercent
o	Methods: getters/setters, updatePrice() (implements interface)
3.	Create Market.java:
o	Maintain a List<Stock>
o	Methods:
	addStock(Stock s)
	getStockBySymbol(String symbol)
	updateMarketPrices() (loop through stocks and change prices randomly)
Output:
Test in console → print all stock names and updated prices.
________________________________________
👩‍💻 Member B – User & Portfolio
Goal: Represent users and their owned stocks.
Start work:
1.	Create abstract User.java:
o	Fields: userId, username, balance
o	Methods: getters/setters, abstract getPortfolioValue()
2.	Create RegularUser.java and PremiumUser.java (extends User):
o	Override getPortfolioValue() (premium users get 2% extra bonus)
3.	Create Portfolio.java:
o	Fields: Map<Stock, Integer> holdings
o	Methods: addStock(), removeStock(), calculateTotalValue()
Output:
Console test — simulate a user buying/selling stocks and display portfolio value.
________________________________________
👨‍💻 Member C – Transactions & History
Goal: Record every buy/sell operation.
Start work:
1.	Create abstract class TransactionBase:
o	Fields: transactionId, userId, stockSymbol, quantity, price, type, date
o	Abstract method: execute()
2.	Create Transaction.java extending TransactionBase:
o	Implement execute() → perform logic for buy/sell (balance updates)
3.	Create TransactionManager.java:
o	Maintain a List<Transaction> for current session
o	logTransaction(Transaction t) and getUserTransactions(int userId)
Output:
Console test — execute buy/sell and print transaction logs.
________________________________________
👩‍💻 Member D – Database & DAO Layer
Goal: Handle all database connectivity and CRUD operations.
Start work:
1.	Set up MySQL database with schema:
o	Tables: users, stocks, portfolio, transactions
2.	Create DatabaseConnection.java → single static method getConnection().
3.	Create DAO classes:
o	UserDAO.java: addUser(), validateLogin()
o	StockDAO.java: getAllStocks(), updateStockPrice()
o	TransactionDAO.java: logTransaction(), getUserTransactions()
4.	Test all CRUD operations in a standalone Main.java.
Output:
Working JDBC connection verified (insert/select working correctly).
________________________________________
👨‍💻 Member E – Frontend + Servlets
Goal: Connect the web UI with backend logic.
Start work:
1.	Create HTML pages:
o	login.html, register.html, dashboard.html, market.html
2.	Create servlets:
o	LoginServlet → uses UserDAO.validateLogin()
o	DashboardServlet → fetches user data and portfolio
o	BuyServlet & SellServlet → call TransactionManager and Portfolio methods
3.	Test locally using Apache Tomcat / GlassFish.
Output:
Form submissions should reach servlets and print backend responses (simple text at first).
________________________________________
🔗 Phase 3: Integration Plan (4–5 hours)
Here’s how everything connects logically:
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
      ↓ (Form Submit / AJAX)
Servlets (Controller Layer)
      ↓
DAO Classes (Database Access)
      ↓
Model Classes (User, Stock, Portfolio, Transaction)
      ↓
Database (MySQL via JDBC)
Integration Steps:
Order	Action	Who Leads	Dependencies
1️⃣	Connect LoginServlet → UserDAO.validateLogin()	Member E + D	DB ready
2️⃣	Load stock list from StockDAO → Market.java → show in market.html	A + D + E	Market module ready
3️⃣	Buy/Sell buttons trigger BuyServlet/SellServlet → call Portfolio + TransactionManager	B + C + E	All logic done
4️⃣	Update portfolio view (PortfolioServlet) → display using table	B + E	Portfolio ready
5️⃣	Test full flow: login → market → buy → dashboard	All	Full integration
________________________________________
🧠 Final Testing & Merge (Last 3–4 hours)
1.	Member E runs the app on local Tomcat server.
2.	Each module tested:
o	Login/Register ✅
o	Stock listing ✅
o	Buy/Sell ✅
o	Portfolio updates ✅
o	Transaction logs ✅
3.	Fix any mismatched method calls or package imports.
4.	Member C or D finalizes README.md (setup + usage instructions).
5.	Member A preps demo data (3 sample users, 5 sample stocks).
________________________________________
🚀 Presentation Plan (for viva/demo)
Each member talks about their OOP contribution:
Member	Topic
A	Interface + Market logic (PriceChangeable, Polymorphism)
B	User hierarchy, composition with Portfolio
C	Abstract class for TransactionBase, Encapsulation
D	DAO layer abstraction + JDBC working
E	Servlet-based integration + Web UI connection flow
________________________________________
Would you like me to make you a shared “Execution Sheet” (Google Sheet-style Markdown table) that shows:
•	Each member’s task list,
•	Start/end times,
•	Dependencies, and
•	Integration checkpoints (with checkboxes)?
It’s perfect to track progress in your 1.5-day sprint and show during viva as project management evidence.
